# The ssh-agent that holds the commit-signing key, and the only place the private
# half of that key ever exists on this Mac: it comes out of 1Password down a pipe
# into ssh-add and is never written anywhere. mac-mini-dotfiles' .gitconfig names no
# key of its own and asks this agent for one through gpg.ssh.defaultKeyCommand — so
# this process is the whole of what makes a commit signable, and losing it costs
# nothing but a re-read.
#
# Run by launchd out of the checkout — ~/.ssh/agent.sh is a symlink to this file,
# installed by claude/ssh-agent.sh — and restarted whenever it exits; that is the
# whole recovery story, since a restart re-reads the key. It waits on the agent
# rather than backgrounding it for the same reason: a job that exits would leave
# launchd thinking the pair had finished.
#
# The socket path is fixed rather than the one ssh-agent would print, because
# launchd hands every login session an SSH_AUTH_SOCK of its own pointing at the
# agent macOS starts, which holds nothing of this. .zshenv and the LaunchAgents in
# mac-mini-dotfiles name this path instead — and it is read from AGENT_SOCKET rather
# than SSH_AUTH_SOCK so that a hand-run never rm's the socket of the agent macOS
# had already put in the environment.
#
# Run it by hand to see what it would do; it logs a line per step, to the terminal
# when there is one and to ~/Library/Logs/ssh-agent.log when launchd is the caller.
