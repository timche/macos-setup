# Xcode proper, which this Mac needs for one thing: signing builds of meru with a
# Developer ID certificate. The command line tools Homebrew brought are enough to
# compile, but not the whole toolchain electron-builder reaches for when it signs
# and notarises, and there is no separate download for that half.
#
# Interactive, and that is why machine.sh only calls it when there is a terminal:
# Apple hands nobody an Xcode without an Apple ID, a 2FA code typed in while it is
# still valid, and then the account password for the privileged end of the install.
# A run with nobody watching is told to come back with a terminal.
#
# Not part of a plain provision either way. It is an 11GB download that takes the
# better part of an hour to unpack, and a Mac without Xcode is still the machine
# the rest of this repo built.
#
# Safe to re-run: an Xcode that is already installed is selected, licensed and
# first-launched rather than fetched again. It is not a way to move versions —
# `xcodes install <version>` is.
