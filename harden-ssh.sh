# Install the sshd hardening drop-in, naming one user in AllowUsers. Run last,
# because it is the step that turns password logins off, and on a Mac that is a
# harder thing to undo than on a VM: there is no provider console to fall back
# to, only Screen Sharing over the same tailnet.
#
# So it refuses when the user has no key sshd could let them in with, which is
# the state a Mac reached with a password is in. FORCE_HARDEN=true overrides
# that, for the case where you are certain of another way in.
#
# The drop-in lands rather than an edit to sshd_config because macOS builds its
# own copy with an `Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*` line in it — one this
# checks for, since without it nothing here has any effect at all. There is
# nothing to restart afterwards: launchd holds port 22 and spawns an sshd per
# connection, so the next login reads the new config and the one running this
# is unaffected.
#
# Safe to re-run, and takes the user to allow as its argument, defaulting to
# whoever runs it.
