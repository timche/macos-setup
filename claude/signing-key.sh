# Install the commit-signing key. Claude-side rather than part of the machine,
# because it is not how the Mac is reached but how it signs as the person whose
# accounts it works from: mac-mini-dotfiles' .gitconfig names no key at all and
# asks the agent for one, and register-signing-key.sh puts the same key on the
# GitHub account that has to accept the signature.
#
# The key is the same one the VM uses and it comes out of 1Password rather than
# being pasted: a paste is a private key on somebody's clipboard, and this is the
# one machine where neither half touches the disk. The private half is read by the
# agent ssh-agent.sh installs, straight into memory, every time it starts; the
# public half is read here only to trust it and to register it, and 1Password stays
# the one place it is kept.
#
# What it needs is a 1Password service account with read access to the vault, whose
# token is stored once and read by both. Nothing prints it.
#
# The allowed_signers git verifies against is the one derived file left, written
# here rather than tracked in the repo. The same key on every machine would make a
# tracked copy correct, but writing it locally costs nothing and keeps a
# credential-shaped file out of public history.
#
# Safe to re-run: a stored token is reused, and the trust list is compared before
# it is rewritten.
