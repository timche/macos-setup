# Install and load the LaunchAgent that keeps the signing key in an ssh-agent of
# its own. Two symlinks into the checkout rather than two copies, now that the
# checkout stays on disk for good — a pull is then the whole of an update, and
# nothing has to be reinstalled to pick one up:
#
#   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.github.timche.ssh-agent.plist -> launchd/<same name>
#   ~/.ssh/agent.sh                                         -> launchd/agent.sh
#
# launchd accepts a symlinked agent plist — it resolves the link at bootstrap and
# remembers the file behind it — and it hands a gui-domain agent a HOME, so the
# plist needs no rendering: a shell in ProgramArguments expands $HOME, and the
# wrapper derives the socket, the log and the token file from the same one. The
# second link is what makes that work wherever MACOS_SETUP_DIR put the checkout:
# ~/.ssh/agent.sh is a fixed path that reaches whatever the checkout's is.
#
# launchd reads a plist only at bootstrap, so a plist that changed is a bootout and
# a fresh bootstrap, while a wrapper that changed is a kickstart. Neither is visible
# in a link that still points where it did, so the wrapper's hash is kept beside it
# and compared. Beside the wrapper rather than beside the plist, because
# ~/Library/LaunchAgents is a directory launchd reads at login and it is for plists.
#
# The agent lives in the gui/<uid> domain, which exists only while the account is
# logged in at the console — so this is the other half of the auto-login
# unattended.sh checks for, and an SSH session against a Mac sitting at its login
# window cannot load it at all.
#
# Safe to re-run: the links and the hash are compared before anything is replaced,
# and launchd is only disturbed when one of them changed.
