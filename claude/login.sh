# The tailnet is the machine's business rather than an account's, so tailscale.sh

Logging in to Claude Code. Same as the others: a URL to open on whichever machine
has a browser, and a code to paste back here, since the callback it would rather
use cannot reach this Mac.

Claude Code keeps the credential in the login keychain on a Mac and falls back to
~/.claude/.credentials.json when the keychain refuses the write, which is what an
SSH session usually gets. If this does not take, `claude setup-token` prints a
token that lasts a year and CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN in the environment is the
other way to carry it.
