# macOS Setup

[![test](https://github.com/timche/macos-setup/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/timche/macos-setup/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Provisioning for a headless Apple Silicon Mac, and optionally for the one that runs Claude Code. As the account the machine is for, which unlike a VM's already exists:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timche/macos-setup/main/bootstrap.sh | bash            # a plain Mac
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timche/macos-setup/main/bootstrap.sh | bash -s claude  # the same, plus Claude Code
```

A fresh Mac has no git and no package manager, so there is nothing to clone this with — which is what `bootstrap.sh` is for. It installs Homebrew, which installs the Xcode command line tools on the way through `softwareupdate` rather than the dialog nobody is in front of, clones this repo to `~/.macos-setup` and runs `machine.sh` as the account you are logged in as. The second form runs `claude.sh` on top, and that is the whole of the difference.

The clone stays, unlike `debian-setup`'s, because a Mac is a machine you pull and re-run rather than one you reprovision from a URL — hidden for the same reason `~/.claude-dotfiles` is, since it is machinery rather than work:

```sh
git -C ~/.macos-setup pull
~/.macos-setup/machine.sh
~/.macos-setup/claude.sh
```

`MACOS_SETUP_DIR` puts it somewhere else. It is not a clone to delete, either: the LaunchAgent that holds the signing key runs `launchd/agent.sh` out of it through a symlink, so moving the checkout means re-running `claude.sh` to point the links at the new place. An earlier run left it at `~/macos-setup`, and `bootstrap.sh` moves that rather than cloning a second copy.

Both halves are safe to re-run, and both are careful about what is already there. That is the difference from provisioning a VM: this Mac was reachable over SSH and on the tailnet before the repo existed, because that is how the repo got onto it, and a second tailscale or a rewritten sshd would be a step backwards rather than a fresh start.

## A fresh Mac

What the scripts cannot do happens at the Mac itself, with a screen and a keyboard, before the first run:

1. Setup Assistant: the account the machine is for, as an administrator. An Apple ID only matters for Xcode, which `xcodes` downloads with it; the iCloud features can all stay off.
2. FileVault off, then Automatic login for that account in System Settings > Users & Groups. Auto-login needs FileVault off, and everything that lives in the login session waits for it after every restart.
3. Remote Login and Screen Sharing on, in System Settings > General > Sharing: the first is how the bootstrap is run from another machine over the LAN, the second is how everything that needs a click gets done once the screen is gone, including the [privacy permissions](#privacy-permissions) below. Screen Sharing is the one of the two no script can turn on, because that pane is also what registers the rights the sharing agent needs.

Then, over SSH on the LAN, the `bash -s claude` form above. It asks, in order, for the sudo password, the account password to turn the screen lock off, a tailnet login URL, the Apple ID and a 2FA code for Xcode, then a GitHub device code, a Claude Code login and the 1Password service-account token.

Afterwards, over Screen Sharing: the [privacy permissions](#privacy-permissions) below, and the project folders added to System Settings > Spotlight > Search Privacy. `machine.sh` names both every time it runs, so a Mac that is missing either says so rather than being quietly slower and quietly unable to take a screenshot.

And in the Tailscale admin console: approve the advertised subnet and exit node, add an `ssh` rule for whoever should reach the Mac, and disable key expiry for it, since a node whose key expires drops off the tailnet after 180 days until somebody logs in at it again.

## The machine

`machine.sh` installs Homebrew and the four packages the rest depends on, turns Remote Login on if it is off, brings tailscale up as a system daemon serving Tailscale SSH, puts docker on the Mac as a colima VM, hardens sshd down to keys only, no root, one user, and — only where there is a terminal to type an Apple ID at — installs Xcode.

`unattended.sh` is the part that makes several parallel sessions on it possible, and all of it is one idea: nothing on this Mac may stop and wait for a click that nobody is there to make.

- **Restart after power loss, and never sleep.** `pmset autorestart 1`, `sleep 0`, `disksleep 0`. A Mac nobody can walk up to is otherwise gone until somebody does. `displaysleep` is left alone: there is no display, and blanking one that is not there costs nothing.
- **No crash dialogs.** `com.apple.CrashReporter DialogType none`, per user. The Electron apps under development here crash as part of the work, and each crash otherwise leaves Problem Reporter's window on the screen with the crashed process waiting behind it. The report still lands in `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`, which is where it is any use. Per user rather than per machine because the two `ReportCrash` processes read the domain of whoever owns the session the crash happened in.
- **No screen lock.** A locked session keeps running — sshd answers, launchd keeps its jobs, builds finish — but every screenshot and recording taken over SSH comes out black, so a session cannot show that what it changed works. Two settings, not one. The screensaver's `idleTime` is still `defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime -int 0`, in the ByHost domain even though Sonoma moved the engine that reads it into a sandbox. The `askForPassword` key next to it has been ignored since Sonoma; `sudo sysadminctl -screenLock off -password -` is the switch now, and it wants this account's own password rather than sudo's, so it runs only where there is a terminal to type one at and prints the command when there is not.
- **macOS updates download but never install.** `AutomaticDownload` on and `AutomaticallyInstallMacOSUpdates` off, in `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate`, plus `softwareupdate --schedule on` for the check itself — `AutomaticCheckEnabled` used to be the fifth key there and macOS 26 drops it, taking the write and leaving the key absent from the file afterwards. An update that installs itself restarts the Mac, and a restart takes every session's worktree state, every running build and every browser with it, then sits at the login window if auto-login is off. Downloaded means installing it is a decision somebody makes, and takes minutes rather than an hour. `ConfigDataInstall` and `CriticalUpdateInstall` stay on — XProtect and the security data files install in place, with no restart and no dialog. Rapid Security Response, renamed Background Security Improvement in 2026, is not settable here at all: it moved to declarative device management, which needs a supervised MDM enrollment. It is on, and it can restart the Mac.

Three things it deliberately does not do, because each needs somebody looking at the screen, which on a headless Mac means Screen Sharing. All three are checked and named on every run rather than assumed:

- **Auto-login.** This matters more than it looks: a LaunchAgent lives in the `gui/<uid>` domain, which exists only while somebody is logged in at the console, so a Mac sitting at its login window is a Mac where neither docker nor anything the Claude half installs is running. Tailscale is deliberately not in that list — its daemon is a LaunchDaemon and comes up without a session, which is why the Mac stays reachable even when this goes wrong. Turning auto-login on means writing the account password to `/etc/kcpassword`, obfuscated rather than encrypted, and that is a decision for whoever owns the Mac rather than for a script. It needs FileVault off. System Settings > Users & Groups > Automatic login.
- **Screen Sharing.** `launchctl enable system/com.apple.screensharing` clears the `Disabled` flag exactly as `remote-login.sh` does for sshd, and for this job that is only half of it: the screen recording rights the sharing agent needs are registered by the Sharing pane itself, so a Mac enabled from a script comes out with the job loaded, the toggle still reading off and nothing answering on port 5900. So `unattended.sh` looks at the port rather than at launchd's opinion of the job, and asks for System Settings > General > Sharing. It is the one to fix first, since it is how the two below get done.
- **The Spotlight privacy list.** `~/projects`, `~/.herdr/worktrees` and `~/.claude-dotfiles/.claude/worktrees`, in System Settings > Spotlight > Search Privacy. A checkout is a few thousand files; the same checkout with `node_modules` in it is a few hundred thousand, and every worktree is another copy, so `mds` spends a core walking files nobody will ever search for by name — again after every install. Nothing scriptable is honoured on current macOS: `.metadata_never_index` is read at a volume root only and is inert in an ordinary directory, `mdutil -i off` takes a volume rather than a path, and the `Exclusions` array in `VolumeConfiguration.plist` can be written by root but changes nothing, because `mds` holds its own copy and only that pane's IPC makes it re-read — `launchctl kickstart -k system/com.apple.metadata.mds` is refused while SIP is on. Renaming a folder to end in `.noindex` is the one mechanism that still works, and is not available to a path that every session and every launchd job names. `unattended.sh` reads the list back and names what is missing from it.

`~/projects` covers Claude Code's worktrees, which it keeps in `<repo>/.claude/worktrees` inside the checkout they belong to. The two outside it are herdr's, which collects them per machine rather than per repo, and `~/.claude-dotfiles`, a checkout like any other but hidden because it is what makes the account rather than work done in it.

`harden-ssh.sh` refuses to disable password logins unless the user has a key sshd could actually let them in with, because on a Mac there is no provider console to fall back to. A Mac reached with a password comes out of a run unhardened and told what to do about it. `FORCE_HARDEN=true` overrides that if you are certain of another way in.

## Privacy permissions

Three grants that no script can make, granted once each over Screen Sharing and then good until somebody revokes them. TCC only ever asks the screen, and there is no supported way in from an SSH session: the consent dialog cannot appear in a session with no window server of its own, and writing the grant into `TCC.db` by hand needs SIP off.

The one thing worth knowing before the list: over SSH the process TCC asks about is sshd's, not the command's. Add `/usr/libexec/sshd-keygen-wrapper`, and on macOS 15 and later `com.apple.sshd-session` as well — the OpenSSH 9.8 split means either can be the one that gets asked, and granting both costs nothing. The panes take no drag from a remote session, so use the **+** button and ⇧⌘G to type a path.

- **Screen Recording** — System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen & System Audio Recording. For `screencapture` and every recording taken over SSH, which is how a session shows a change working rather than asserting it, and for herdr, which reads the panes it drives. Without it `screencapture` still exits 0 and still writes a PNG; the PNG is black.
- **Accessibility** — System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility. Same two entries. This is what lets a session reach into another app's windows — focus, keystrokes, clicks — which is how herdr drives anything with a GUI.
- **Notifications** — System Settings > Notifications, per app rather than per binary. For the Electron app under development, so that a notification it posts is delivered rather than dropped. Its entry only exists once the app is signed and has asked for permission at least once, so the order is run it, let it ask, then allow it; before that there is nothing in the list to switch on.

To check them afterwards, over SSH:

```sh
screencapture -x /tmp/shot.png && ls -l /tmp/shot.png
```

A real desktop is hundreds of kilobytes. A black frame is a few, whatever the resolution — which is the tell, since the exit status and the file are the same either way. Copy it off and look at it if the size is ambiguous.

```sh
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to count processes'
```

Accessibility: a count means the grant is there, and `-25211 osascript is not allowed assistive access` means it is not.

macOS 15 and later also put up a "requesting to bypass the system private window picker" dialog every so often, even with the grant in place. It is the one modal this repo cannot switch off, and it needs Screen Sharing and a click — worth knowing about when screenshots start coming back wrong for no reason.

## Tailscale

`tailscale.sh` installs the open-source `tailscale` formula, starts `tailscaled` as a root system daemon with `sudo brew services start tailscale`, and sets the three prefs this Mac is on the tailnet for: Tailscale SSH, its LAN advertised as a subnet, and itself offered as an exit node.

The daemon rather than the standalone app, even though both can serve Tailscale SSH. A system daemon runs before anybody logs in, so a Mac whose auto-login fails or whose GUI session dies is still on the tailnet and still reachable — where the app is a login item inside a session, which is the dependency that already makes docker and the signing agent wait for one. Tailscale call this the less-tested variant on macOS and point unattended installs at it, which is what this Mac is. The two are not meant to coexist: two `tailscaled` fighting over one tunnel is a node that drops off at random, so `tailscale.sh` warns when it finds `/Applications/Tailscale.app` and leaves removing it to whoever installed it. `sudo brew services start` rather than `sudo tailscaled install-system-daemon`, which Tailscale documents next to it, because the brew service runs Homebrew's own binary: `brew upgrade tailscale` moves the daemon with it, where `install-system-daemon` copies the binary to `/usr/local/bin` and pins the daemon to that copy.

The subnet comes from the interface the default route leaves by — its address and netmask, turned into a network and a prefix — so a Mac moved to another LAN needs a re-run rather than an edit. `TS_ADVERTISE_ROUTES` overrides it, and set-but-empty advertises no subnet at all. Nothing here touches IP forwarding: on macOS Tailscale enables it itself when routes are advertised. An exit node on macOS routes in userspace and only while the machine is awake, which is what `unattended.sh`'s `pmset sleep 0` is for.

A node that has never logged in needs `tailscale up`, which prints a URL to open on a machine that has a browser and then waits for it — so `tailscale.sh` runs it only where there is a terminal to wait at, and prints the command when there is not. Everything after that is `tailscale set`, which changes prefs without starting a login, and which only runs where the prefs differ from what the script asks for. A Mac configured by hand comes out of a run untouched.

MagicDNS is the one thing the daemon will not do for itself: it leaves the system resolver alone where the app rewrites it. So `tailscale.sh` writes `/etc/resolver/<tailnet>.ts.net` holding `nameserver 100.100.100.100`, which sends tailnet names to Tailscale and leaves every other lookup with the resolvers the Mac already had. Pointing the machine's own DNS servers at 100.100.100.100 would be the other way to do it, and would break all DNS whenever Tailscale is down.

Two things only the tailnet can do, both in [the admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin): approve this machine's advertised subnet and its exit node, unless `autoApprovers` in the policy file already covers them, and allow Tailscale SSH to it with an `ssh` rule saying who may connect and as whom. Until that rule exists nothing reaches the SSH server tailscaled is running.

To see where it is:

```sh
tailscale status                       # the node, the tailnet, and who else is on it
sudo tailscale debug prefs             # RunSSH, and AdvertiseRoutes with the subnet and 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
sudo brew services list                # whether the daemon is loaded
sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding          # 1 once routes are advertised, and Tailscale's doing
scutil --dns | grep -B2 -A2 100.100.100.100   # the resolver file, as macOS reads it
```

## Docker

`docker.sh` installs colima, the docker CLI and the compose and buildx plugins, writes the shape of a Linux VM into colima's profile config, and hands the starting of that VM to `brew services` so that it comes back with the machine. There is no Docker Desktop here: that is an app, with an installer that expects somebody at the screen and a licence to go with it, where colima is a CLI that starts a VM and gets out of the way.

The VM is Virtualization.framework — `vmType: vz` — with Rosetta on, which is what runs an amd64 image at close to native speed. It gets every core but two and a quarter of the memory — the rest is for the parallel sessions running browsers and Electron outside it, since a VM rarely hands memory back — both read from the hardware so that a different Mac needs no edit, and a 100GiB disk, which is a ceiling rather than a reservation because the image is sparse.

`brew services` means a LaunchAgent, and a LaunchAgent lives in the `gui/<uid>` domain — so docker is running only once the Mac has logged itself in, exactly like the agent holding the signing key. A Mac at its login window has no docker.

To see where it is:

```sh
colima status                                # the VM, and the socket docker talks to
docker context show                          # colima, the context colima sets when it starts
docker run --rm hello-world
brew services list                           # whether the LaunchAgent is loaded
tail -f /opt/homebrew/var/log/colima.log     # why the VM did not come up
```

The VM, its disk, its images and its volumes are all under `~/.colima`, and nothing outside it belongs to docker. `colima delete` starts over, and is also how all of that is lost.

To resize it, edit `~/.colima/default/colima.yaml` and restart — `colima stop && colima start --edit` does both. That file is the one `docker.sh` writes, and colima rewrites it in its own fully commented form on the first start. `cpu` and `memory` take effect at the next start and a disk can grow, but a disk cannot shrink and `vmType` and `mountType` are fixed when the VM is created, so changing either of those means deleting the VM. Re-running `docker.sh` resizes nothing: it reports where the config and the hardware disagree and leaves whatever is there alone.

## Xcode

`xcode.sh` installs the full Xcode, which this Mac needs for signing builds of meru with a Developer ID certificate — the command line tools Homebrew brought are enough to compile but not the whole toolchain electron-builder reaches for. It is the one step of the machine `machine.sh` will not do unattended: Apple hands nobody an Xcode without an Apple ID, a 2FA code typed in while it is still valid, and the account password for the privileged end of the install. `machine.sh` runs it when there is a terminal and lists it under what is left when there is not.

```sh
~/.macos-setup/xcode.sh
```

It stops before downloading anything if `/` has less than 40GB free, since the xip is around 11GB and unpacks to more than twice that before the copy into `/Applications`. The download comes through [`xcodes`](https://github.com/XcodesOrg/xcodes) — `--latest`, so a release and never a beta — and then the script selects what it installed, accepts the licence and runs the first launch, each one guarded so that a re-run asks for nothing.

`xcodes` remembers the Apple ID and keeps its password in the login keychain. This Mac is reached over SSH, where a keychain that needs to ask for anything cannot, so that write may be refused — in which case xcodes says so and asks for the Apple ID again next time, `XCODES_USERNAME` and `XCODES_PASSWORD` in the environment answer it without a keychain at all, and `xcodes signout` clears whatever is stored.

To see where it is:

```sh
xcode-select -p        # /Applications/Xcode-<version>.app/Contents/Developer
xcodebuild -version
xcodes installed       # every Xcode on the Mac, and which one is selected
```

Signing needs one thing `xcode.sh` has no business fetching: the Developer ID certificate and its private key in the login keychain, imported from wherever it is kept with `security import <certificate>.p12 -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db -T /usr/bin/codesign`.

## The Claude Code overlay

`claude.sh` installs nothing — every package is Homebrew's and Homebrew is the machine's. What it does is the part that needs an account: it logs in to GitHub and to Claude Code, installs the commit-signing key, and hands over to the private `claude-dotfiles` for everything after that — the shell, the prompt, the runtimes and `~/.claude`. Run it against a Mac `machine.sh` has already built, and rerun it when a token expires.

The GitHub token goes in a file rather than the login keychain (`gh auth login --insecure-storage`). This Mac is reached over SSH and does its work from LaunchAgents, and both of those meet a keychain that will not answer with a prompt nobody sees. Claude Code keeps its own credential in the keychain and falls back to `~/.claude/.credentials.json` when the write is refused, which is what an SSH session usually gets; if the login does not take, `claude setup-token` prints a token that lasts a year and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` carries it instead.

## The signing key

The key is the same one every machine here signs with, and it lives in 1Password. Only its public half is ever written to this Mac — `~/.ssh/claude.pub`, which `claude-dotfiles`' `.gitconfig` points `user.signingkey` at, plus a line in `~/.ssh/allowed_signers` so git can verify what it signs. The private half is read out of 1Password straight into an ssh-agent, over a pipe, every time that agent starts. There is no file to leak and nothing to paste.

What it expects:

- A 1Password item with the key in it, at `op://Claude/SSH Key`, whose `private key` and `public key` fields are the two halves. `SIGNING_KEY_OP_ITEM` names a different one.
- A 1Password service account with read access to that vault. `claude/signing-key.sh` asks for its token once, without echoing it, checks it can read the item, and stores it in `~/.config/op/service-account-token` for the agent to read at every start.

The agent is a LaunchAgent, `io.github.timche.ssh-agent`, running `~/.ssh/agent.sh`, which is a symlink to `launchd/agent.sh` in the checkout: it starts an `ssh-agent` on a fixed socket at `~/.ssh/agent.sock`, loads the key into it, and then waits on it, so that launchd restarting the pair is also what re-reads the key. The socket is fixed because the one launchd hands out belongs to the agent macOS starts for each session, which holds nothing of this and is not visible to an SSH login at all — `claude-dotfiles`' `.zshenv` and its own LaunchAgents name `~/.ssh/agent.sock` instead. At boot the key cannot be read until the network is up, so the agent comes up empty and keeps trying with a widening delay.

Both halves of it are links into the checkout rather than copies, so a pull is all a change to either needs — `~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.github.timche.ssh-agent.plist` points at the plist in `launchd/` and `~/.ssh/agent.sh` at the wrapper beside it. launchd accepts a symlinked agent plist and hands the job `HOME`, so that plist holds no absolute path at all: `/bin/sh -c 'exec "$HOME/.ssh/agent.sh"'` is what expands one, and the wrapper derives the socket, the log and the token file from `$HOME` itself. It reads a plist only when the job is bootstrapped, though, so `claude/ssh-agent.sh` still boots the job out and back in when the plist changed, and restarts it with `launchctl kickstart -k` when only the wrapper did — which it knows from a hash of the wrapper kept in `~/.ssh/agent.sh.sha256`.

To see where it is:

```sh
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/io.github.timche.ssh-agent   # loaded, and what launchd makes of it
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/.ssh/agent.sock ssh-add -l                # the key, or nothing yet
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/ssh-agent.log                      # why it is nothing yet
git commit --allow-empty -m test && git log --format='%G?' -1
```

An `invalid format` from git rather than a `G` usually means exactly one thing: the agent does not hold the key, and `ssh-keygen -Y sign` has fallen back to reading the public key as a private one.

## Two things worth knowing

There are two ways in and different things govern them. Over the tailnet it is Tailscale SSH, which tailscaled answers itself: the policy file decides who may connect and as whom, and nothing in the sshd configuration has any say over those sessions. On the LAN it is sshd, which `harden-ssh.sh` locks down to keys, no root and one user, and which is what is left when Tailscale is down. Keeping both is deliberate — a tailnet that cannot be reached is no reason to be locked out of a machine in the next room — and Screen Sharing is the third door, for whoever can walk up to it.

macOS reads `sshd_config` per connection — launchd holds port 22 and spawns an sshd per client — so there is nothing to restart after the drop-in lands, and a config it cannot parse breaks the next login rather than waiting for one. That is why the drop-in is checked with `sshd -t` and taken straight back out if it does not hold up.

## Environment knobs

`MACOS_SETUP_REPO`, `MACOS_SETUP_DIR`, `CLAUDE_DOTFILES_REPO`, `CLAUDE_DOTFILES_DIR`, `SIGNING_KEY_OP_ITEM`, `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_FILE`, `FORCE_HARDEN`, `TS_ADVERTISE_ROUTES`.

`CLAUDE.md` has the details: the order the scripts run in, the constraints that are not obvious from reading them, and how to test.
