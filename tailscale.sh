# tailscale on the Mac, which is the network this machine is reached over. What it
# leaves is a node that serves Tailscale SSH, advertises the LAN it is plugged
# into as a subnet, and offers itself as an exit node.
#
# The open-source tailscaled from Homebrew rather than the standalone app. Both
# can serve Tailscale SSH, so that is not the reason: tailscaled is a system
# daemon and runs before anybody logs in, so a Mac whose auto-login fails or whose
# GUI session dies is still on the tailnet and still reachable — where the app is
# a login item inside a session, the same dependency that makes docker and the
# signing agent wait for one. Tailscale call tailscaled on macOS the less-tested
# variant and point unattended installs at it, which is what this is.
#
# A step of its own because it is the one part of the machine that is also the way
# the machine is reached: once this Mac is on the tailnet, every later run of it
# comes in over what it configures, so the best outcome is to change nothing.
#
# Not fatal. By the time this runs the rest of the machine is built, and a tailnet
# can be sorted out afterwards.
#
# Safe to re-run: a tailscaled that is already a system daemon is left exactly as
# it is, the prefs are written only where they differ from what is asked for here,
# and the login is only offered when there is nobody logged in yet.

  - Allow Tailscale SSH to it — an ssh rule naming who may connect and as whom.
    Until there is one, nothing reaches tailscaled's SSH server, and sshd on the
    LAN is the only way in:
