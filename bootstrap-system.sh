# machine has. Needs sudo the first time only — Homebrew's installer is what wants
# it, and everything after that lands in a prefix the account owns.
#
# The packages are the Brewfile's, including the ones docker.sh and tailscale.sh
# used to install for themselves: Homebrew is the machine, so one declarative list
# says what it has and each of those scripts is left to decide about the daemon and
# the VM. The Brewfile says which two packages stay out of it and why.
#
# Safe to re-run: an existing Homebrew is left alone and --no-upgrade keeps an
# already-installed package at the version it is on, so a re-run is not a way to
# move versions.

# xcode-select, so a Mac with Xcode proper is left alone too.
