# What makes a Mac with nobody in front of it keep going: it comes back on its
# own after power loss, it never sleeps, it never puts a dialog up that something
# waits behind, it never restarts itself for an update, and it has a GUI login
# session to come back into.
#
# The parallel Claude Code sessions are what this is for. Each one builds, runs
# Electron apps that crash, and takes screenshots to show a change working, and
# every one of those is a thing that stops dead at a modal or at a locked screen.
#
# Three of them cannot be arranged from here at all, so this checks and says so
# rather than pretending. Auto-login needs the account password written to
# /etc/kcpassword, obfuscated rather than encrypted. Screen Sharing and the
# Spotlight privacy list both need a click that macOS will not take from a
# script — see the README, which says where each one lives and what it is for.
#
# Not fatal, any of it. A Mac that sleeps, locks or comes up at the login window
# is still a Mac.
#
# Safe to re-run: every write is guarded on a read of what is already there.

# macOS updates

# Downloaded, never installed. An update that installs itself restarts the Mac,
# and a restart takes every session's worktree state, every running build and
# every browser with it — and then waits at the login window if auto-login is
# off. Downloaded means the install is a decision somebody makes, on a machine
# they have looked at, and it takes minutes rather than an hour of downloading.
#
# ConfigDataInstall and CriticalUpdateInstall stay on. Those are XProtect, its
# remediator and the security data files: they install in place, without a
# restart and without a dialog, which is the one kind of automatic update that
# costs nothing here.
#
# Rapid Security Response — Background Security Improvement, as of 2026 — is not
# among them. It moved to declarative device management
# (com.apple.configuration.softwareupdate.settings), which needs a supervised
# MDM enrollment, so there is no key here to set it with either way. It is on by
# default and it can restart the Mac; nothing in this repo can change that.
#
# In /Library/Preferences, because these govern the machine rather than the
# account: a bare com.apple.SoftwareUpdate from a user shell is that user's own
# domain and nothing reads it. The MDM profile payload carrying the same keys is
# deprecated in macOS 26 and gone in 27, but that is how a fleet locks the
# setting down — the local preferences these toggles read and write are a
# different path, and this Mac is enrolled in nothing.
#
# Read back through sudo as well as written through it: `defaults` run by root
# creates a plist the account cannot read, so a guard that read it as the user
# would miss on a Mac where the file did not exist before — and then write on
# every run.

# Spotlight

# Kept out of the folders the sessions work in. A checkout is a few thousand
# files; the same checkout with node_modules in it is a few hundred thousand, and
# every worktree is another copy — so mds spends a core walking files nobody will
# ever search for by name, again after every install.
#
# Checked, not set, because on current macOS nothing scriptable is honoured:
#
#   - `.metadata_never_index` in the folder is read at a volume root only. Put in
#     an ordinary directory it is inert, and a file created under one is indexed
#     within the minute exactly as if it were not there.
#   - `mdutil -i off` takes a volume or a store, not a path, and turning
#     indexing off for the whole data volume is not what is wanted — Spotlight
#     still has to find an app.
#   - The Exclusions array in VolumeConfiguration.plist, below, is the privacy
#     list itself, and root can write it. It changes nothing: mds holds its own
#     copy and only the Sharing pane's IPC makes it re-read, where
#     `launchctl kickstart -k system/com.apple.metadata.mds` is refused outright
#     while SIP is on.
#   - Renaming a folder to end in `.noindex` does work, and is the one thing that
#     does. It is also not available here: every session, every worktree and
#     every launchd job names ~/projects.
#
# So the list is read back and the folders missing from it are named. Reading it
# needs root, and a Mac being provisioned by hand should not meet a second
# password prompt inside a check.
