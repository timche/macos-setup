# An entry point, and the usual one: bootstrap.sh exists for a Mac that does not
# have this repo yet and calls this the moment it does. Running it again from the
# clone is how a change is picked up.

# Safe to re-run. Everything here checks the machine before touching it, which is
# the point on a Mac rather than a VM: this one was reachable over SSH and on the
# tailnet before the repo existed, and a second tailscale or a rewritten sshd
# would be a step backwards.
