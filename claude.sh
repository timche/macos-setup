# The Claude Code overlay: the half of the provisioning that needs a GitHub, an
# Anthropic or a 1Password account. machine.sh leaves a working Mac; this is what
# turns that Mac into the one Claude Code runs on.
#
# The second entry point, and the only one that is optional. bootstrap.sh runs it
# when asked to, running it by hand against a Mac machine.sh already built is the
# other way in, and it is what you rerun when a token expires.
#
# It installs nothing: every package either half needs is brew's, and brew is the
# machine's. What is here is accounts and keys — and the handover to
# mac-mini-dotfiles, which is the private half that brings the shell, the runtimes
# and Claude Code itself.
#
# Safe to re-run: logins already in place are left alone, and the dotfiles clone
# is pulled rather than recloned.
