# The signing key and its agent, driven end to end with 1Password stubbed out: a
# key generated here, a stub op that serves its two halves, and then the real
# signing-key.sh, the real plist and the real wrapper. What it proves is the part
# that matters — that a commit signs with a key no file on the machine holds.
#
# Everything runs against a throwaway HOME. launchd hands a gui-domain agent the
# account's home directory rather than this one, which the plist now leaves it to
# resolve — so ssh-agent.sh installs its links here and deliberately loads nothing,
# and the wrapper is run the same way launchd runs it, with a HOME of its own.
# test/agent-links.sh is the other half of this, and covers what launchd does with
# those links for the account it really belongs to.
#
# To add a case, add a check line: a description and a shell snippet that exits
# non-zero when the expectation is not met.
