# The agent as launchd actually loads it: claude/ssh-agent.sh against the account
# this runs as, with no service-account token anywhere — which is every Mac between
# machine.sh and the first signing-key.sh, and enough to prove the plumbing. The
# agent comes up empty and stays up; the key itself is signing-agent.sh's, with a
# stub 1Password and a HOME of its own.
#
# What it is here for is the two things the links have to make true: that launchd
# accepts a plist that is a symlink into the checkout, and that a wrapper which
# changed in the checkout restarts the job rather than being ignored.
#
# It refuses to run outside CI unless MACOS_SETUP_TEST_ANYWAY=1, for the same reason
# signing-agent.sh does — launchd keys a job by label per account, so this bounces
# the agent holding the real key — and because it edits launchd/agent.sh in the
# checkout to make the restart happen.
#
# To add a case, add a check line: a description and a shell snippet that exits
# non-zero when the expectation is not met.
